# Whats New in Version 3.1

## Deprecation of SailDelegate

With a patch of moduleName, we no longer need the SailDelegate for the current time. This will mean that it is deprecated for the current time. This may change in the future.

## .gitignore

We didn't have a GitIgnore in the project. We now do!

# WARNING: Future Seperation

In the future, this file will be seperated into two, with any files regarding UIKit or AppKit being seperated into another file. Only exception will be typealiases due to their use in other current SDK/API's using SailSDK.
